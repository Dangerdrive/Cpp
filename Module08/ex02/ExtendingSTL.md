This exercise demonstrates the implementation of a **`MutantStack`**, which is a custom stack class that extends `std::stack` to provide **iterator support**. Normally, `std::stack` does not allow iteration over its elements (since it’s designed as a LIFO container with restricted access). Here’s what’s new and interesting about this exercise:

### **Key Concepts Demonstrated**
1. **Extending `std::stack`**  
   - `MutantStack` publicly inherits from `std::stack<T>` to retain all stack functionality (`push`, `pop`, `top`, etc.).  
   - The underlying container of `std::stack` (default: `std::deque`) is exposed to enable iteration.

2. **Adding Iterator Support**  
   - `std::stack` does not provide iterators, but its underlying container (accessible via `std::stack<T>::c`) does.  
   - `MutantStack` provides `begin()`, `end()`, reverse iterators (`rbegin()`, `rend()`), and their `const` versions.

3. **Comparison with `std::list`**  
   - The `main.cpp` tests `MutantStack` alongside `std::list` to show identical iteration behavior.  
   - Proves that `MutantStack` can be used like a sequence container (e.g., for algorithms that require iterators).

4. **Template and Typedef Usage**  
   - The `typedef`s for iterators are derived from `std::stack<T>::container_type` (the type of the underlying container, e.g., `std::deque<T>`).  
   - This makes the code generic and reusable for any stack specialization.

### **Why This Exercise Matters**
- **Bridging Interfaces**: It shows how to adapt a restricted container (`std::stack`) to work like a sequence container (e.g., `std::list` or `std::vector`).  
- **Understanding STL Internals**: Reveals that `std::stack` is just a wrapper around an underlying container (by default, `std::deque`).  
- **Real-World Use Case**: Useful when you need stack semantics (LIFO) but also want to iterate over elements (e.g., debugging, logging, or custom traversal).

---

### **Critical Implementation Details**
1. **Underlying Container Access**  
   - The `std::stack`'s underlying container is protected (not private), so we can access it in the derived class.  
   - The member `c` (defined in `std::stack`) holds the actual data (e.g., `std::deque<T>`).

2. **Iterator Functions**  
   ```cpp
   iterator begin() { return std::stack<T>::c.begin(); }  // Expose deque's begin()
   iterator end() { return std::stack<T>::c.end(); }      // Expose deque's end()
   ```
   - These functions delegate to the iterators of the underlying container.

3. **Copy Constructor and Assignment**  
   - Explicitly defined to ensure proper deep copying (though the default would work here, it’s good practice).

---

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Prevent Slicing**  
   - If someone copies a `MutantStack` into a `std::stack`, iterators would be lost. To prevent this:  
     ```cpp
     private:
       using std::stack<T>::operator=;  // Hide stack's assignment (optional)
     ```

2. **Move Semantics**  
   - Add move constructor and move assignment for modern C++ efficiency:  
     ```cpp
     MutantStack(MutantStack&& other) noexcept : std::stack<T>(std::move(other)) {}
     MutantStack& operator=(MutantStack&& other) noexcept {
         std::stack<T>::operator=(std::move(other));
         return *this;
     }
     ```

3. **Compatibility with C++11+**  
   - Use `using` instead of `typedef` for clarity:  
     ```cpp
     using iterator = typename std::stack<T>::container_type::iterator;
     ```

### **Conclusion**
This exercise teaches how to **extend STL containers** to add missing features (like iterators) while preserving their original behavior. The `MutantStack` is a clever hack that reveals the flexibility of the STL’s design.  

**Use Case Example**:  
If you need a stack but also want to print all elements (without popping), `MutantStack` provides a clean solution.
