# Analysis of C++ Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions

This module focuses heavily on exception handling while also reinforcing object-oriented programming concepts. Each exercise builds upon the previous one, creating a complete bureaucratic system with increasingly complex exception handling requirements.

## Main Theme: Exception Handling
Yes, this exercise list is fundamentally about exceptions. The module title "Repetition and Exceptions" indicates its dual focus on reinforcing OOP concepts while teaching robust exception handling patterns in C++.

## Exercise Objectives Breakdown:

### Exercise 00: Bureaucrat Class
**Primary Objective**: Implement basic exception handling
- Create a class with constrained values (grade 1-150)
- Implement custom exceptions (`GradeTooHighException`, `GradeTooLowException`)
- Practice throwing exceptions in:
  - Constructor (invalid initialization)
  - Increment/Decrement operations (boundary violations)
- Learn proper exception catching with try-catch blocks
- Implement operator overloading for output

### Exercise 01: Form Class
**Primary Objective**: Expand exception handling to class interactions
- Create a second class that also uses grade-based exceptions
- Implement interaction between classes (Bureaucrat signs Form)
- Add more complex exception cases:
  - Form signing requirements
  - Different messages for success/failure cases
- Practice propagating exceptions between classes

### Exercise 02: Abstract Forms and Concrete Implementations
**Primary Objective**: Polymorphic exception handling
- Convert Form to abstract base class (AForm)
- Create derived form classes with specific behaviors
- Implement execution requirements with exceptions:
  - Form must be signed
  - Bureaucrat must have sufficient grade
- Handle different failure modes (like robotomy 50% failure)
- Practice polymorphic exception handling through base class interface

### Exercise 03: Intern Class
**Primary Objective**: Factory pattern with error handling
- Implement a form creation factory
- Handle invalid form requests gracefully
- Practice clean solutions to avoid if-else chains
- Demonstrate proper resource management (returning Form pointers)
- Show comprehensive error reporting for invalid cases

## Progressive Learning Path:
1. Basic exceptions in a single class (00)
2. Exceptions in class interactions (01)
3. Polymorphic exceptions in inheritance hierarchy (02)
4. Creation-time exceptions and factory pattern (03)

The exercises cleverly use the bureaucratic metaphor to create a realistic scenario where exceptions naturally occur (invalid grades, insufficient permissions, form processing failures), making the technical concepts more memorable and engaging.
