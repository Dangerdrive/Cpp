# Heap Or Stack ?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "../includes/Zombie.hpp"

int main() {
    Zombie* zombieCat = newZombie("Oli Zombie"); // Heap allocation
    zombieCat->announce(); // Accessing heap-allocated object

    randomChump("Gin Zombie"); // Stack allocation

    delete zombieCat; // Explicit deallocation of heap memory
}
```

## Heap Allocation: newZombie("Oli Zombie")
The function newZombie likely allocates a Zombie object on the heap using new.

Example implementation of newZombie:

```cpp

Zombie* newZombie(std::string name) {
    return new Zombie(name); // Allocate Zombie on the heap
}

```
The pointer zombieCat points to this heap-allocated object.

**Why use heap allocation here?**

The object needs to persist beyond the scope of the function where it was created.
We will need it to use announce().

Then we must explicitly deallocate it using delete.

## Stack Allocation: randomChump("Gin Zombie")
The function randomChump likely creates a Zombie object on the stack.

Example implementation of randomChump:

```cpp

void randomChump(std::string name) {
    Zombie zombie(name); // Allocate Zombie on the stack
    zombie.announce();   // Use the object
} // 'zombie' is automatically deallocated here
```
**Why use stack allocation here?**

The object is short-lived and only needed within the scope of the function.

Memory management is automatic, so no need for delete.


## Summary

Use stack allocation for short-lived, scope-bound objects.

Use heap allocation for objects that need to persist beyond the current scope or have dynamic lifetimes.

Always pair new with delete to avoid memory leaks.
