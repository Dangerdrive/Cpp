Yes, you're correct! When you're performing all those operations in your code (whether it's comparisons, arithmetic, or increment/decrement), you are indeed operating on the **member value** (`_value`) of the `Fixed` class. Let's break it down step by step, and I'll explain how each operation interacts with this member value.

### 1. **The Member Value (`_value`)**
- The `Fixed` class stores its fixed-point number as an integer in the `_value` member.
- This value represents the number in a scaled form, where the fractional part is scaled by `1 << _fractionalBits` (which is `256` because `_fractionalBits` is 8). For example, a value like `5.05f` gets stored as `5.05 * 256`, which is `1292.8`, rounded to `1293` when using the constructor that takes a `float`.

### 2. **Comparison Operators**
When you use comparison operators (e.g., `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`), the operations are performed on the `_value` member of the two `Fixed` objects being compared.

```cpp
bool Fixed::operator>(const Fixed& other) const {
    return this->_value > other._value;  // Compare the _value member
}
```

In this case, `this->_value` is the value of the current object (`*this`), and `other._value` is the value of the other `Fixed` object (`other`). The comparison checks if the current object's `_value` is greater than the other object's `_value`.

### 3. **Arithmetic Operators**
For arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, you're performing operations on the `_value` of the two objects, but the result is stored in a **new `Fixed` object**. Here's how it works for the addition operator:

```cpp
Fixed Fixed::operator+(const Fixed& other) const {
    return Fixed(this->toFloat() + other.toFloat());  // Add the floating-point representations
}
```

In this example, `this->toFloat()` converts the current object's `_value` into a float, and `other.toFloat()` does the same for the other object. The result of the addition is then converted back into a `Fixed` object and returned. Essentially, you first get the floating-point representations of the numbers, perform the addition, and then create a new `Fixed` object to store the result.

The underlying `toFloat()` function converts the integer representation of the fixed-point number back to a normal floating-point value:
```cpp
float Fixed::toFloat() const {
    return (float)this->_value / (1 << _fractionalBits);
}
```

This way, the raw fixed-point values are used for calculations, but the results are often stored as a new `Fixed` object.

### 4. **Increment/Decrement Operators**
When you increment or decrement the `Fixed` object, you're modifying the `_value` member. Here's an example of the pre-increment operator:

```cpp
Fixed& Fixed::operator++() {
    this->_value += 1;  // Increment the _value member by the smallest representable step
    return *this;  // Return the modified object
}
```

In this case, you directly modify the `_value` of the current object (`*this`) by adding 1 (which corresponds to the smallest representable `Ïµ`, as per the scale of the fixed-point value). The result is the updated object with the new `_value`.

### 5. **Static Member Functions (min, max)**
The `min` and `max` functions don't modify any objects themselves; they simply return references to the smallest or largest `Fixed` object based on the values of `_value`. For example:

```cpp
Fixed& Fixed::min(Fixed& a, Fixed& b) {
    return (a < b) ? a : b;  // Compare the _value members of a and b
}
```

Here, the function compares `a._value` and `b._value` and returns a reference to the object with the smaller `_value`.

### 6. **The Main Program**
In the `main` function, you're using a mix of the operations:

```cpp
Fixed a;
Fixed const b(Fixed(5.05f) * Fixed(2));

std::cout << a << std::endl;        // Output the float representation of a's _value
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;      // Pre-increment a, modifying a's _value
std::cout << a << std::endl;        // Output the updated _value of a
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;      // Post-increment a, returning the old _value of a
std::cout << a << std::endl;        // Output the updated _value of a
std::cout << Fixed::max(a, b) << std::endl;  // Output the max of a and b
```

The output `0.00390625` after `++a` is the correct and expected behavior due to how fixed-point arithmetic works in your implementation. Let me break it down step by step:

### Why `++a` gives `0.00390625`

1. **Initial State**
   - `a` is initialized with the default constructor, setting `_value = 0`
   - In fixed-point representation (with 8 fractional bits), this is `0.0`

2. **Pre-increment Operation (`++a`)**
   - Your pre-increment operator is defined as:
     ```cpp
     Fixed& Fixed::operator++() {
         this->_value += 1;  // Adds 1 to the raw integer value
         return *this;
     }
     ```
   - Since you're using 8 fractional bits (`_fractionalBits = 8`), adding `1` to `_value` actually adds:
     - `1` in the raw integer representation
     - Which equals `1 / (2^8) = 1/256 = 0.00390625` in floating-point

3. **Fixed-Point Precision**
   - With 8 fractional bits, the smallest representable number (epsilon) is `1/256 = 0.00390625`
   - This is why `++a` increases the value by this smallest possible amount

### Key Insight
In fixed-point arithmetic (with 8 fractional bits):
- Integer `1` represents `1/256` in floating-point
- This is because the actual value is stored as `value * 256` (since we're using 8 bits for the fractional part)

### Demonstration
```cpp
Fixed a;  // _value = 0 (0.0 in float)
++a;      // _value = 1 (which is 0.00390625 in float)
```

But your current implementation is technically correct for fixed-point arithmetic - it's just important to understand that in this system, integer `1` represents a very small fractional value.




### Summary:
- All the operations (comparison, arithmetic, increment/decrement, min/max) are working directly with the `_value` member of the `Fixed` class.
- Arithmetic operations are usually done by first converting the `_value` to a floating-point number for precision, performing the operation, and then returning a new `Fixed` object with the result.
- The increment/decrement operations directly modify the `_value`.
- Comparison operations work directly on the `_value` to determine which object is greater, smaller, etc.
  
So, yes, all these operations are happening at the level of the member value `_value` inside the `Fixed` class!
