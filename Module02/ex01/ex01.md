The **overloaded operator `<<`** in C++ allows you to define custom behavior for how an object of a class is inserted into an output stream (like `std::cout` or any other output stream). It is typically used for printing objects in a human-readable form.

Letâ€™s break down your example:

### Example of the overloaded operator:
```cpp
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Fixed& obj) {
    os << obj.toFloat();
    return os;
}
```

### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Function Signature**:
   ```cpp
   std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Fixed& obj)
   ```
   - `std::ostream& os`: The left-hand side of the stream (e.g., `std::cout`, or any stream object).
   - `const Fixed& obj`: The object of class `Fixed` that we want to print. The object is passed as a reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
   - `std::ostream&`: The function returns a reference to an output stream, which allows chaining of stream operations (e.g., `std::cout << obj1 << obj2`).

2. **The Body**:
   ```cpp
   os << obj.toFloat();
   ```
   - This sends the result of `obj.toFloat()` to the output stream `os`. The `toFloat()` method is expected to return a floating-point value (probably a `float` or `double`), which will then be printed to the stream.
   
   If `obj.toFloat()` returns, say, `3.14`, then this line effectively outputs `3.14` to the stream `os`.

3. **Returning the Stream**:
   ```cpp
   return os;
   ```
   - Returning the output stream `os` allows for **chaining** stream operations. This means that you can use multiple `<<` operators in a single statement. For example:
     ```cpp
     std::cout << obj1 << obj2 << obj3;
     ```
     This works because after `operator<<` is called, it returns the `os` stream, and you can continue using it with the next `<<` operation.

### Example Usage:

Now, consider you have a `Fixed` class with this overloaded operator, and you want to print an object of type `Fixed` to the console.

Example of `Fixed` class:
```cpp
class Fixed {
public:
    float toFloat() const {
        // Suppose this returns some float value
        return 3.14f;
    }
};
```

If you then do something like:
```cpp
Fixed obj;
std::cout << obj << std::endl;
```

The output would be `3.14`, because the overloaded `<<` operator calls `obj.toFloat()` and prints its result to the output stream `std::cout`.

### Why Overload the `<<` Operator?
- **Custom Output**: By overloading the `<<` operator, you define how the `Fixed` objects should be represented when output.
- **Chaining**: The return of the stream (`os`) allows you to chain multiple `<<` operations together.
- **Improved Readability**: It lets you easily print complex objects without needing explicit `toString()` methods or `printf()` calls.

### Summary
The overloaded `operator<<` in this case allows you to send a `Fixed` object to an output stream (like `std::cout`). It prints the `Fixed` object by first converting it to a float using `obj.toFloat()`. Returning the stream allows for chaining of output operations.
