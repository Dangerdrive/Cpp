```cpp
std::istringstream iss(line);
```

This line creates an **input string stream** from the string `line`.

### 🔍 What does it do?

`std::istringstream` is a class from the `<sstream>` header that allows you to **treat a string like an input stream**, similar to how you use `std::cin`.

### ✅ In this context:

Suppose the line is:

```
2009-01-02,0.5
```

Then:

```cpp
std::istringstream iss(line);
```

creates a stream from the string `"2009-01-02,0.5"`, so you can extract values from it using `std::getline` with a custom delimiter (in this case, `','`).

This part:

```cpp
std::getline(iss, date, ',') && std::getline(iss, rateStr)
```

means:

* Extract everything before the first comma into `date`.
* Then extract the rest into `rateStr`.

So:

* `date` becomes `"2009-01-02"`
* `rateStr` becomes `"0.5"`

### 🧠 Summary:

* `std::istringstream iss(line);` lets you parse a line of text easily.
* It’s used here to split each line from the file into a `date` and a `rate`.

Let me know if you’d like a minimal example to play with.
