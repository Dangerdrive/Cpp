# Pointers to Member Functions in C++

In C++, **pointers to member functions** allow you to store and call member functions of a class dynamically. This is particularly useful when you want to associate specific functions with certain conditions or events, as demonstrated in the `Harl` class example. Below, I’ll explain how pointers to member functions work and how they are used in the `Harl` class.

---

## **Key Concepts**

### **1. What is a Pointer to a Member Function?**
- A pointer to a member function is a variable that stores the address of a member function of a class.
- Unlike regular function pointers, member function pointers require an object to be called on.

### **2. Syntax for Pointers to Member Functions**
- The syntax for declaring a pointer to a member function is:
  ```cpp
  ReturnType (ClassName::*PointerName)(ParameterTypes);
  ```
  - `ReturnType`: The return type of the member function.
  - `ClassName`: The class to which the member function belongs.
  - `PointerName`: The name of the pointer variable.
  - `ParameterTypes`: The types of the function parameters (if any).

- Example:
  ```cpp
  void (Harl::*ComplaintFunction)();
  ```
  - This declares a pointer named `ComplaintFunction` that can point to a member function of the `Harl` class that takes no arguments and returns `void`.

---

### **3. Assigning a Member Function to a Pointer**
- To assign a member function to a pointer, use the address-of operator (`&`) and qualify the function with the class name.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  ComplaintFunction = &Harl::debug;
  ```

---

### **4. Calling a Member Function Through a Pointer**
- To call a member function through a pointer, use the `.*` or `->*` operator.
  - `.*` is used when you have an object.
  - `->*` is used when you have a pointer to an object.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  (object.*PointerName)();
  ```
  or
  ```cpp
  (objectPtr->*PointerName)();
  ```

## **How It Works in the `Harl` Class**

The `Harl` class uses pointers to member functions to dynamically call the appropriate complaint function based on the input level. Here’s how it works:

---

### **File: `Harl.hpp`**
```cpp
#ifndef HARL_HPP
#define HARL_HPP

#include <string>

class Harl {
private:
    // Private member functions for each complaint level
    void debug();
    void info();
    void warning();
    void error();

    // Typedef for a pointer to a member function
    typedef void (Harl::*ComplaintFunction)();

    // Array of function pointers
    ComplaintFunction complaintFunctions[4];

    // Array of level names
    std::string levels[4];

public:
    // Constructor
    Harl();

    // Public member function to complain
    void complain(std::string level);
};

#endif
```

**Key Points**:
- A `typedef` is used to define `ComplaintFunction` as a pointer to a member function of the `Harl` class that takes no arguments and returns `void`.
- Two arrays are declared:
  - `complaintFunctions`: An array of pointers to member functions.
  - `levels`: An array of strings representing the complaint levels.

---

### **File: `Harl.cpp`**
```cpp
#include "../includes/Harl.hpp"
#include <iostream>

// Constructor: Initialize function pointers and level names
Harl::Harl() {
    complaintFunctions[0] = &Harl::debug;
    complaintFunctions[1] = &Harl::info;
    complaintFunctions[2] = &Harl::warning;
    complaintFunctions[3] = &Harl::error;

    levels[0] = "DEBUG";
    levels[1] = "INFO";
    levels[2] = "WARNING";
    levels[3] = "ERROR";
}

void Harl::debug() {
    std::cout << "[ DEBUG ]\n"
              << "I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-special-ketchup burger. I really do!\n"
              << std::endl;
}

void Harl::info() {
    std::cout << "[ INFO ]\n"
              << "I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn’t put enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn’t be asking for more!\n"
              << std::endl;
}

void Harl::warning() {
    std::cout << "[ WARNING ]\n"
              << "I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I’ve been coming for years whereas you started working here since last month.\n"
              << std::endl;
}

void Harl::error() {
    std::cout << "[ ERROR ]\n"
              << "This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now.\n"
              << std::endl;
}

void Harl::complain(std::string level) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        if (levels[i] == level) {
            (this->*complaintFunctions[i])(); // Call the appropriate member function
            return;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "[ UNKNOWN LEVEL ]\n"
              << "Harl doesn't know how to complain about this level.\n"
              << std::endl;
}
```

**Key Points**:
- The constructor initializes the `complaintFunctions` array with pointers to the `debug`, `info`, `warning`, and `error` member functions.
- The `complain` function iterates through the `levels` array to find a match for the input `level`.
- If a match is found, the corresponding member function is called using the pointer:
  ```cpp
  (this->*complaintFunctions[i])();
  ```

---

### **File: `main.cpp`**
```cpp
#include "../includes/Harl.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Harl harl;

    std::cout << "Testing Harl's complaints:\n" << std::endl;

    harl.complain("DEBUG");
    harl.complain("INFO");
    harl.complain("WARNING");
    harl.complain("ERROR");

    harl.complain("UNKNOWN");

    return 0;
}
```

**Key Points**:
- The `main` function creates an instance of `Harl` and calls the `complain` function with different levels.
- The `complain` function dynamically calls the appropriate member function based on the input level.

---

## **Expected Output**

```
Testing Harl's complaints:

[ DEBUG ]
I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-special-ketchup burger. I really do!

[ INFO ]
I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn’t put enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn’t be asking for more!

[ WARNING ]
I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I’ve been coming for years whereas you started working here since last month.

[ ERROR ]
This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now.

[ UNKNOWN LEVEL ]
Harl doesn't know how to complain about this level.
```

## **Summary**

- **Pointers to member functions** allow you to store and call member functions dynamically.
- They are declared using the syntax `ReturnType (ClassName::*PointerName)(ParameterTypes)`.
- To call a member function through a pointer, use the `.*` or `->*` operator.
- In the `Harl` class, pointers to member functions are used to associate complaint levels with specific functions and call them dynamically.

This approach is flexible and allows for clean, maintainable code, especially when dealing with multiple functions that need to be called based on certain conditions.
